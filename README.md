# Machine Learning

This repository is about EC 503 Learning From Data course. Resources about the project will be collected here. 

* Dataset: 
    * Check the dataset folder
    * Matlab files folder contains dataset_ordering.m file which takes .csv files as an input and generates a training&test data for the python scripts. 

* Environment:
    * conda 4.5.11
    * Python 3.6.6

* Make sure that anaconda is updated. 
    * conda update conda
    * conda update anaconda
    
* Code view:

Code environment is Jupyter notebook, one can run .ipynb files in a jupyter notebook format. Before running the scripts, make sure that you downloaded all project because datasets are loaded from specific path. If you want to use your own path make sure that you change inside the scripts. 
   *  BaggingClassifier.ipynb: Bagging classifier implementation
   *  Boosting.ipynb: Boosting classifier implementation
   *  Stacking_ec_503.ipynb: Stacking classifier implementation
   *  Version_sum.py: File for checking relevant python packages but necessary for script to run
